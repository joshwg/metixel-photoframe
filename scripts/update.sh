# Metixel Photoframe — atomic Blue/Green OTA updater.
#
# Stages a new release into /opt/metixel/releases/<version>, installs its
# system + pip packages, swaps the /opt/metixel/live symlink atomically,
# restarts services, verifies the new release boots (health-check), and
# rolls back to the previous release if it doesn't.
#
# WORKFLOW
#   1. Staging:   clone the target tag into a temp dir, then rename to
#                 releases/<version>.
#   2. Install:   install system + pip packages (NEW deps). STRICT — any
#                 failure (e.g. no internet) ABORTS here, deletes the staging
#                 dir, and leaves the live release untouched.
#   3. Units:     reconcile /etc/systemd/system with the units shipped by the
#                 release (backed up first).  /etc/systemd/system is NOT part
#                 of the Blue/Green swap, so without this step an upgrade would
#                 run NEW code under OLD unit files.
#   4. Remove:    uninstall Metixel-managed packages no longer required by the
#                 new manifests (apt remove + pip uninstall).
#   5. Config:    back up the live config (and the unit files) before the swap
#                 for rollback safety.
#   6. Swap:      ln -sfn releases/<version> live  (atomic flip).
#   7. Restart + health-check: restart services, poll the health endpoint.
#                 On failure, flip live back to the previous release, restore
#                 the config AND the unit files, and restart.
#   8. Record:    update installed_packages.json to the new manifest set.
#
# Rollback (crucial): if any step before the symlink swap fails, the staging
# folder is deleted and the live system remains on the OLD (working) release.
# After the swap, a failed health-check restores both the config and units.
#
# Usage: sudo bash scripts/update.sh <version|git-ref> [REPO_URL] [--dry-run] [--staged-dir DIR]
#   <version|git-ref>   Release folder name + tag/branch/commit (e.g. v2.0.0)
#   REPO_URL            Git remote to clone from (default: origin of live repo)
#
# Flags:
#   --dry-run           Print what would happen and exit without touching the
#                       device.  Nothing is cloned, installed, swapped or
#                       restarted — safe to run anywhere to inspect the plan.
#   --staged-dir DIR    Use an ALREADY-CLONED checkout at DIR instead of
#                       cloning.  Used by scripts/bootstrap.sh, which must
#                       clone anyway (it needs this script to exist before it
#                       can run), and by local development to install a
#                       working tree without pushing.  DIR is moved into
#                       ${RELEASES_DIR}/<name>, so it must be on the same
#                       filesystem as the install root.
#
# NOTE ON CLONE DEPTH: the clone is deliberately FULL, not shallow.  The
# application relies on a real git repository on the device:
#   * update_manager._resolve_repo_root() looks for .git to locate the repo;
#   * `git reset --hard` / `git fetch` are used for in-place operations; and
#   * a shallow clone cannot be used for local debugging patches (`git push`).
# A shallow clone would silently break all three, so depth is not constrained.
