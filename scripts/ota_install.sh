# Metixel OTA — install steps.
#
# This script is invoked by scripts/update.sh AFTER the new release has been
# staged into releases/<version>. Because it lives IN the repository, it always
# reflects the NEW version being installed — a device upgrading from an older
# release therefore applies the current install logic (system packages + runtime
# pip dependencies), not the logic baked into the code that was already running.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/ota_install.sh [REPO] [--continue-on-error]
#   REPO                  Path to the repository checkout (default: /opt/metixel/live)
#   --continue-on-error   If set, log failures and keep going (legacy behaviour —
#                         used for non-OTA contexts).  Otherwise ANY failure
#                         (e.g. no internet) aborts so the Blue/Green swap never
#                         happens on an incomplete install.
#
# Must be idempotent — it runs on every upgrade.

# release `live` points at, and the runtime config/data tree is resolved
# relative to it.  This script used to bridge a pre-Blue/Green device by
# invoking scripts/migrate_to_atomic.sh, but that migration has been retired —
# the layout is now established by scripts/update.sh, which creates `live`
# BEFORE calling here (see the "Fresh install: establish 'live'" step), and the
# last monolithic release was 1.2.1.
#
# Fail CLOSED rather than guess.  If `live` is missing or dangling we are being
# run outside the supported flow; installing anyway would write packages
# against a path that systemd cannot resolve, and in strict mode a half-applied
# install is worse than a clean abort.  This mirrors update.sh's own
# "is not a Metixel checkout" validation below.
