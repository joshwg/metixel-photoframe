**The picture frame, not the dashboard.**<br>
No clocks, no widgets, no weather overlays. Metixel treats your photographs and videos like art, with nothing to distract from the moment.

**The Favorite-to-Frame workflow.**<br>
Stop letting everyday memories get forgotten in the cloud. Connect Metixel to an Immich album, and any photo you favourite on your phone automatically goes straight to your wall. Or simply upload photos from your phone.

**Zero-terminal setup.**<br>
DIY hardware shouldn't require a computer science degree. Once installed, Metixel is managed entirely from a web interface — no SSH, no config files, no command-line rituals.

## Build Your Own Frame

Any Raspberry Pi makes a beautiful wall frame. My own build paired an old
monitor with a custom frame and matte, the Pi mounted discreetly behind. For
step-by-step inspiration, see these guides on [building a 32-inch 4K frame with a Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.thedigitalpictureframe.com/how-i-built-a-stunning-32-inch-4k-digital-picture-frame-with-a-raspberry-pi-4-featuring-smooth-image-crossfading-transitions/), [creating a DIY frame in under twenty minutes](https://medium.com/women-make/diy-digital-photo-frame-in-less-than-20-minutes-69bc35ed6364), and [making a digital photo frame](https://www.noahrousell.com/blog/making-a-digital-pho/).

## Get started

Metixel goes from download to your first slideshow in about ten minutes:

| | Step | What you'll do | Go |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Download** | Grab the pre-built image for your Pi | [Latest release](https://github.com/dennisadvani/metixel-photoframe/releases/latest) |
| 2 | **Install** | See what hardware you need, then flash the image — or install manually (the OS username **must be `pi`**; the installer refuses anything else) | [Installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md) |
| 3 | **Set up your frame** | Connect to Wi-Fi, open the dashboard, add your photos | [Set up your frame](docs/INSTALLATION.md#set-up-your-frame) |
| 4 | **Questions?** | Troubleshooting and quick fixes | [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) |
