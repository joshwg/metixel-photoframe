Two paths to a running Metixel frame. Both work on Raspberry Pi 3, 4, and 5;
you must take the manual path for Raspberry Pi 2.

> Pi 4 is supported but **untested**. Pi 2 is **manual install only** (no pre-built .img — 32-bit). Pi Zero 2 W is **untested** and manual install only.

| | Path A: Pre-built image | Path B: Manual install |
|---|---|---|
| **Time** | ~10 minutes | ~1 hour |
| **Skill level** | Beginner | Comfortable with terminal |
| **What you get** | Complete OS with Metixel pre-installed | Stock Trixie + Metixel installed via script |
| **Best for** | Most users, quick setup | Tinkerers, Pi 3 with limited SD cards, inspecting the install |

Both produce an identical result — a Pi that boots directly into the Metixel
slideshow with the web dashboard accessible on port 80.

---

## What you need (hardware)

Metixel runs on a Raspberry Pi with 1GB+ of RAM. A Pi 3 (1GB) is recommended
for 1080p playback; a Pi 5 (2GB+) for 4K. A Pi 2 will work, but transcoding is
slow.

| Model | GPU | Max Playback | Video Transcoding | Tested | OS | .img Available |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pi 5 | VideoCore VII | 4K | Yes | Yes | Trixie 13 Lite (64-bit) | Yes |
| Pi 4 | VideoCore VI | 4K (untested) | Yes | No | Trixie 13 Lite (64-bit) | Yes |
| Pi 3 B/B+ | VideoCore IV | 1080p | Yes | Yes | Trixie 13 Lite (64-bit) | Yes |
| Pi 2 B | VideoCore IV | 1080p | Yes | Yes | Trixie 13 Lite (32-bit) | No — Manual Install |
| Pi Zero 2 W | VideoCore IV | No (RAM Limit) | No (RAM Limit) | No | Trixie 13 Lite (32-bit) | No — Manual Install |

### RAM requirements

| RAM | Photo Playback | Video Playback | Image Optimisation | Video Transcoding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 512MB | Yes | No | No | No |
| 1GB | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes — up to 1080p H.264 |
| 2GB | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes — up to 4K H.265 (Ultrafast) |
| 4GB+ | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes — 4K H.265 at Higher Qualities |

> **Notes:**
> - A SWAP file is **required** on all models.
> - Pi 3 and Pi 2 hardware video decoder is limited to **1080p** — higher-resolution video must be transcoded down.
> - Exhausting memory and swap will cause the Raspberry Pi to lock up and eventually reboot.
> - **Phase 2 (planned):** Radxa Zero 3W (Rockchip RK3566, Mali G52).

### Required accessories

- MicroSD card (8GB minimum, Class 10 recommended)
- 5V power supply (3A for Pi 5, 2.5A for Pi 2/3/4, 1.2A for Zero 2 W)
- HDMI cable + display (1080p recommended)
- Optional: IR receiver (TSOP38238 + GPIO), HDMI-CEC capable TV
- Optional: DDC/CI-capable monitor + `ddcutil` (installed with system packages) for picture controls from the Advanced page — needs a full HDMI cable (some cheap adapters/KVMs strip DDC) and I²C access (`i2c` group / `/dev/i2c-*`)

**Tested on:** Raspberry Pi 2 (1GB), Pi 3 (1GB), and Pi 5 (2GB) running Debian
Trixie (13) Lite.

## Quick Start (Pi 3+)

```
1. Download the pre-built image from GitHub Releases
2. Flash it with Raspberry Pi Imager
3. Boot your Pi → done.
```

**[Download latest release](https://github.com/dennisadvani/metixel-photoframe/releases/latest)**

Then continue with **[Set up your frame](#set-up-your-frame)** below.

---

## Path A: Pre-built image (recommended)

### 1. Download

Go to the **[latest release](https://github.com/dennisadvani/metixel-photoframe/releases/latest)**
and download `metixel_trixie_vX.X.X.img.zip` (~1.4 GB).

### 2. Flash

Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/):

1. **Choose OS** → **Use custom** → select the `.img.zip` file.
2. **Choose Storage** → select your SD card.
3. Click **Write**.

> **Note:** Pi Imager's advanced options (gear icon) are not available for
> custom images. Configure Wi-Fi after boot using the captive portal or
> Ethernet — see the **[User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md)**.

Alternatively, use `dd` or any other flashing tool:

```bash
unzip metixel_trixie_vX.X.X.img.zip
sudo dd if=metixel_trixie_vX.X.X.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

### 3. Boot

Insert the SD card, connect HDMI and power. The Pi boots directly into
Metixel.

### 4. Connect

Continue with **[Set up your frame](#set-up-your-frame)** below.

---

## Path B: Manual install (flash Trixie yourself)

Use this if you want to start from a clean Debian Trixie install — for
example, on a Pi 3 where you want a smaller initial SD card footprint, or
if you want to inspect or modify the install process.

### 1. Flash Debian Trixie Lite

1. Download **Debian Trixie (13) Lite** for Raspberry Pi from the
   [Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/).
2. Flash it with Raspberry Pi Imager (select "Raspberry Pi OS Lite" and
   choose the Trixie version) or use `dd`.
3. In Pi Imager's ⚙ settings (**OS customisation** → **Set username and
   password**), set the username to **`pi`** — the installer refuses to run
   on any other username, because the systemd units, `update.sh` and
   `reconcile.sh` all hard-code `pi`. Optionally pre-configure Wi-Fi and
   enable SSH here too so you can access the Pi after boot without a keyboard.

### 2. Boot the Pi

Insert the SD card, connect HDMI, Ethernet (recommended for the install),
and power. Log in as `pi` (or via SSH).

### 3. Run the bootstrap installer

On a fresh Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Trixie) image, download the installer and run
it:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dennisadvani/metixel-photoframe/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh
sudo bash bootstrap.sh
```

> **Download first, then run the file.** Do not pipe the script into `sudo bash`
> (`curl ... | sudo bash`). bash reading its program from a non-seekable stdin,
> while `sudo` performs the exec, loses its read-ahead position and aborts
> partway through with `syntax error near unexpected token ')'`. Running a
> downloaded file avoids this entirely. To be certain the download is intact,
> `bash -n bootstrap.sh` first — it parses without running anything.

Or, to install from a checkout you already have (development):

```bash
sudo bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --local /path/to/checkout
```

The installer asks two questions before changing anything:

- **Release channel** — `stable` (newest tagged release), `beta` (newest
  pre-release) or `dev` (the dev branch)
- **WiFi country code** — sets the radio's regulatory domain (e.g. `AU`,
  `US`, `GB`) so the correct channels are used

Supply them up front to skip the prompts entirely:

```bash
sudo bash bootstrap.sh --channel stable --wifi-country AU
```

Other flags, if you need them:

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Print exactly what would happen, then exit without changing anything. Safe to run anywhere. |
| `--repo URL` | Install from a different git remote (e.g. your own fork). |
| `--skip-boot-config` | Skip `scripts/configure_boot.sh`. Use it if you manage `/boot/firmware/config.txt` yourself — the installer then does not need a reboot. |

> There is deliberately **no** uninstaller flag on `bootstrap.sh`: it refuses to
> run over an existing installation. To remove Metixel, use
> `scripts/uninstall_metixel.sh`.

> **Why `bootstrap.sh` is a separate, tiny script.** It only obtains a
> checkout and then delegates to `scripts/update.sh` — the *same* script that
> performs OTA updates. So a fresh install and an upgrade share one code path,
> and installing exercises staging, the health check and rollback too. Because
> `bootstrap.sh` rarely changes, it rarely needs to be promoted to `main` — all
> the logic that evolves lives inside the checkout.

> **No git checkout is left at the install root.** Code lives in
> `/opt/metixel/releases/<version>` and the root holds only `data/`,
> `releases/`, `live` and `run/`. Future updates go through `update.sh` (the
> web UI or CLI), not `git pull`.

After answering, press Enter to begin. The installer runs for 30–60 minutes:

| Step | What it does |
|---|---|
| 1 | Installs `git` (needed to obtain a checkout) |
| 2 | Resolves the chosen channel to a tag/commit and clones it |
| 3 | Hands off to `scripts/update.sh`, which installs system packages (cage, XWayland, Mesa, ffmpeg, VLC, Samba, hostapd, dnsmasq) and Python packages, stages the release, swaps `live`, then health-checks and rolls back on failure |
| 4 | Reconciles host configuration via `scripts/reconcile.sh` — the data tree, systemd units, I²C/ddcutil, WiFi power saving, port 80→8080, Samba, captive portal and linger |
| 5 | Applies boot configuration via `scripts/configure_boot.sh` (KMS overlay, `gpu_mem`) |

Installer answers (channel, WiFi country) are written to
`/opt/metixel/data/init.json` — a partial config overlay. The application and
`reconcile.sh` each read it, and the app consumes it once on first start
(renaming it to `init.json.applied`), so `config.json` remains solely the
application's to create and own.

### 4. Reboot

The script reboots the Pi automatically. After reboot, Metixel starts and
you'll see the boot animation on screen.

### 5. Connect

Continue with **[Set up your frame](#set-up-your-frame)** below.

---

## Set up your frame

The Pi has booted into Metixel — time to connect it to your Wi-Fi and put
some photos on it.

### Connect to Wi-Fi

Metixel will show a PIN on screen and create a Wi-Fi hotspot called
**"Metixel-Setup"**. Connect to it from your phone or laptop:

1. Join the `Metixel-Setup` Wi-Fi network (no password needed).
2. Open a browser and go to **http://192.168.42.1**.
3. Enter the 4-digit PIN shown on the frame's display.
4. Select your home Wi-Fi network and enter the password.
5. The frame connects and the hotspot disappears.

> **Using Ethernet instead?** Just plug in a cable. Open
> `http://metixel.local` or find the Pi's IP in your router's DHCP list and
> go to `http://<ip>`. Configure Wi-Fi from the **Network** tab in the
> dashboard.

> **Wi-Fi disabled?** If the image was written with Wi-Fi switched off (Pi
> Imager or pi-gen), Metixel turns the radio on automatically the first time the
> backend starts, so the hotspot above still appears. After that first boot the
> radio is yours — Metixel never changes it again. You can flip it at any time
> with the **WiFi Radio** switch on the dashboard's **Network** page.

For alternative Wi-Fi setup methods (SSH, raspi-config, etc.), see the
**[User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md)**.

### Open the dashboard

From any device on the same network, open a browser and go to:

```
http://metixel.local
```

Or use the IP address shown on the frame's display — e.g. `http://192.168.1.50`.

The dashboard lets you:
- Add media folders to watch
- Configure Immich sync
- Change slideshow settings (duration, transitions, fit mode)
- Set a display sleep schedule
- Check for OTA updates

### Add your photos

You have several options — pick whichever fits your setup:

| Method | Best for | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Web upload** | Anyone on the network | Dashboard → Media Library → Upload Media (or drag & drop); opens the phone gallery on mobile |
| **Samba share** | Windows/Mac users | Open `\\metixel\metixel-media` (Windows) or `smb://metixel/metixel-media` (Mac), drag files in |
| **Immich** | Existing Immich users | Enter your Immich server URL + API key in the dashboard → Sync tab |

New files are detected automatically and appear in the slideshow within a
minute or two (larger files take longer due to optimisation).
