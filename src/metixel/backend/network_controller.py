"""Network Controller — single owner of WiFi/AP state machine.

All AP activation/deactivation and PIN management flows through this
class.  No other module may start/stop hostapd or mutate PIN state
directly — this eliminates the race conditions between the network
monitor thread and Flask web request threads.

WiFi hardware constraint (enforced by this controller):
    wlan0 can be in client mode OR master (AP) mode — never both.
    ``is_connected()`` (nmcli) is NOT called while AP_ACTIVE because
    it can interact with the radio and disrupt hostapd beacons.
