"""Processing journal — single-writer persisted state for the media pipeline.

Records per-file lifecycle + processing outcome so that:

* the folder watcher never re-picks-up the same file twice within a run
  (a file in a terminal state with an unchanged fingerprint is skipped),
* permanently-failed transcodes are remembered across restarts and are
  **not** retried forever (no doomed re-encode on every boot),
* the web UI can show *why* an item is missing from the slideshow
  (failed / skipped with a reason).

This is a **single-writer controller**: every mutation goes through this
class — it owns the only lock and the only write path to disk — so the
concurrent threads (folder watcher, optimisation queue, web API) can never
interleave writes to the journal file.

The journal lives inside the cache directory (``<cache_dir>/processing_state.json``)
so that "Clear cache" wipes it along with the processed files, forcing a clean
full rebuild.  Writes are debounced and atomic (temp file + ``os.replace()``).
