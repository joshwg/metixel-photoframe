"""Optimisation Queue — background media processing with threshold gating.

Runs as a background thread in the backend daemon.  Receives metadata-only
``MediaItem`` stubs from the ``FolderWatcher`` and decides whether each
item needs optimisation:

* **Images**: optimised if pixel dimensions exceed the configured threshold
  (default: display resolution).  Images at or below the threshold are
  added directly to the slideshow playlist.

* **Videos**: transcoded if pixel dimensions exceed the configured threshold
  OR the codec is not H.264.  Videos within limits in a compatible codec
  are added directly to the slideshow playlist.

Priority order (per user specification):
1. Ready-to-play items are pushed to the playlist immediately.
2. Image optimisation runs first (higher priority).
3. Video optimisation runs after all images are done.
4. If new items arrive during video processing, the current job finishes
   before switching back to images.
