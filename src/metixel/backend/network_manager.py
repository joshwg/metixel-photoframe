"""Network Manager — Wi-Fi scanning, connection, and AP fallback.

Uses ``nmcli`` (NetworkManager CLI) for all Wi-Fi operations.  NetworkManager
is available on Trixie/Bookworm and handles wpa_supplicant safely behind the

AP (access point) mode is controlled via systemd units for hostapd and

def set_wifi_radio(enabled: bool) -> bool:
    """Enable or disable the Wi-Fi radio at the OS level.

    Returns True when the requested state was reached, False otherwise.  Unlike
    :func:`is_wifi_radio_enabled` this reports real failures rather than failing
    open — callers use the result to decide whether to persist a first-run
    marker, so a transient nmcli failure must be detectable.

    Enabling is deliberately THREE steps, in this order:

      1. ``rfkill unblock wifi`` / ``unblock wlan`` — clears a software RF-kill
         block.  A Raspberry Pi Imager image whose WiFi was disabled at imaging
         time arrives in exactly this state (``nmcli radio`` shows
         ``WIFI-HW=enabled WIFI=disabled``), and step 2 alone does NOT clear it.
         Both type names are unblocked: ``wifi`` is an alias that some builds
         resolve only to the wlan type, while ``wlan`` is the raw sysfs type.
      2. ``nmcli radio wifi on`` — re-enables the NetworkManager radio.
      3. ``nmcli device set wlan0 managed yes`` — re-adopts a device that was
         marked unmanaged while blocked.  Without this the radio reads as on but
         no connection is possible.

    Disabling is a single ``nmcli radio wifi off``; NetworkManager persists that
    choice itself, so nothing else is required (and nothing is written to
    config).

    All commands run via ``sudo -n`` — the backend service is unprivileged and
    relies on a NOPASSWD sudoers entry, the same mechanism as AP mode control.
    ``-n`` keeps this non-interactive: it fails fast instead of hanging on a
    password prompt in a daemonised process.
